# Personal List Management App

A native iOS/macOS app for managing structured lists (todos, books, movies, restaurants, etc.) using Obsidian markdown folders as the storage backend.

## Project Status

🚧 **Phase 1: Core Engine Development** (In Progress)

Currently implementing the core Swift library for parsing and managing lists from markdown files.

## Features (Planned)

- **Multiple list types**: Todos, books, movies, restaurants, places to visit
- **Obsidian-compatible**: Uses markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Hierarchical tags**: Organize with nested tags like `#work/projects/linear`
- **Powerful filtering**: Filter by tags, dates, types, completion status
- **Saved views**: Create and save custom filtered views
- **On-device AI**: Use Apple Intelligence for content processing
- **Cross-platform**: iOS first, macOS to follow

## Architecture

- **Phase 1** (Current): Core engine in Swift (Linux-compatible for development)
- **Phase 2** (Next): iOS app with SwiftUI + Apple Intelligence integration

## Development Approach

Using the Ralph loop technique with Claude Code for autonomous development.
